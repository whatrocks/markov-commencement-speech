ðŸŽ“ Generate your own commencement speeches with Markov chains and a [dataset](https://floydhub.com/whatrocks/datasets/commencement) of some of the world's "best" commencement speeches.

`The secret to success in start-ups, or any other collaboration, is to stick an old head on a motorcycle weaving his way down the hall, he passed a door â€“ it was empty.`

### Try it now

Click this button to open a Workspace on FloydHub where you can generate your own "commencement speech style" sentences in a live JupyterLab environment. The [commencement address dataset](https://floydhub.com/whatrocks/datasets/commencement) of ~300 famous speeches will be automatically attached and available in the Workspace.

The `speech_maker` notebook has three sections for you to try:

1. Using the entire dataset
2. Filtering to only the top ten schools by count of speeches given
3. Filtering to one school at a time using an Jupyter widget

### Public dataset

The [commencement address dataset](https://floydhub.com/whatrocks/datasets/commencement) is a plaintext collection of some of the world's most famous commencement speeches. This repo contains a CSV with metadata for each speech (speaker `name`, `school`, and `year`).

The list of speeches originally started with NPR's [The Best Commencement Speeches, Ever](https://apps.npr.org/commencement/), a site I frequent often. Transcripts were available for many but not all of the speeches.

If you're in need of your daily dose of clichÃ©, trope, and sentimentality, you can view the speeches [here](https://whatrocks.github.io/commencement-db/) in a simple Gatsby.js site.
